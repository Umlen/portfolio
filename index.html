                <h3>About myself</h3>
                <p>
                    For the last five years, I've been working at a meat processing plant, 
                    where I've made a nice career from a PC Operator to a Production Manager. 
                    But now I'm highly motivated to switch my career and become a front-end developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why did I choose front end? I like that front-end development is a 
                    combination of design and programming. Also, front end is a part of a website 
                    that users are directly interacting with, and I really enjoy making 
                    simple and beautiful things for users' convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since December 2021, I've completed 3 courses on FreeCodeCamp 
                    (Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, 
                    and Front-End Development Libraries). Now I'm going through the Frontend Career Path 
                    from Scrimba, making challenges from Frontendmentor, and solving Kata from CodeWars. 
                    So now I've got some experience of using HTML + CSS/SCSS, JS and a little React.js.
                </p>

                    If you are interested in someone who has great motivation and a strong interest 
                    in becoming a front-end developer but doesn't have real experience yet,
