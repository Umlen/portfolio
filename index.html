                <p>
                    For the last five years I've been working at a Meat Processing Plant, 
                    where I made a nice career from a PC Operator to a Production Manager. 
                    But now I highly motivated to switch my career and become a Front End Developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why I choose frontend. I like that Front End Development 
                    makes a combination of design and programming. 
                    Also Front End it's a part of a website or an app which users are directly 
                    interacting with and I really enjoy to make a simple and beautiful things 
                    for user's convenience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since December 2021 I've completed 3 courses on FreeCodeCamp 
                    (Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, 
                    Front End Development Libraries). Now I go through the Frontend Career Path 
                    from Scrimba, make challenges from Frontendmentor, and solve Kata from CodeWars.
                    So now I got some experience of using HTML + CSS / SCSS, JS and a little of React.js.

                    into become a Front End Developer, but don't have a real experience yet,
